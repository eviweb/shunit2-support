Shunit2 Support
===============
this little lib aims to help managing [shunit2](https://github.com/kward/shunit2) in your project.    

Installation
------------
* clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/eviweb/shunit2-support.git`
* run the installer `shunit2-support/install.sh`    
_this will create a link to the `shunit2-support/src/sshunit2` command in your `$HOME/bin` directory_   

> _Please note that if the `$HOME/bin` does not exist, it will be created.   
> In this case you will need to refresh your environment. (ie. by running `exec bash -l`)_

**To remove the `sshunit2` command:** run the installer with the `-u` flag: `shunit2-support/install.sh -u`
